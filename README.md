## Description
A social media web application built using ASP.NET, aiming to connect people with similar personal project ideas.
	
## Functionalities
The micro-social platform has 3 types of users: 
<ul>
	<li> Unregistered User </li>
	<li> Registered User </li>
	<li> Admin </li>
	</ul>
  Any user can search for other accounts by name/username and can view other profiles if they are made public by the owner.   Registered Users can add and edit a personal public/private profile that enables them to friend request other members and join groups. They can post on the platform and discuss via comments. Groups also have their private group chats accessible by membership.
  The Admin has full rights over the platform and is able to CRUD any entity and send notifications to users.
	
## Technologies
* ASP.NET MVC 5
* Bootstrap for front-end
* Entity Framework 6.0
